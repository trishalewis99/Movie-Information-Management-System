      <span>OMDB</span> is an online database of information related to movies â€“ including cast, production crew, plot summaries, critical reviews, and ratings. It is a community-built movie database. Every piece of data has been added by our amazing community. Our strong international focus and breadth of data is largely unmatched and something we're incredibly proud of. Put simply, we live and breathe community and that's precisely what makes us different. This website was made as a part of our DBMS and WDL projects.
